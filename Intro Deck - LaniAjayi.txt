The Commercial Diplomat for Ecosystem-Led Growth and Global Market Expansion.

OLUWALANI AJAYI GLOBAL CONSULTING LTD
The Growth Problem
Most scale-ups try to grow by hiring more salespeople to make more cold calls.
This is the "Sales Treadmill." It is expensive, slow, and yields diminishing returns as Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) rise.
"You don't need more leads. You need Distribution Leverage."
The Solution: Alliances
Instead of hunting clients one-by-one, we partner with the "Gatekeepers" who already own your audience.
Banks & Fintechs (Trust)
Integrators & Platforms (Access)
Resellers & Agencies (Volume)

DEAL ARCHITECT
Bridging the Execution Gap
Partnerships often fail because Sales teams overpromise and Legal teams kill momentum. Deals die in "Legal Limbo."
I am the bridge.
I combine 10+ years of Legal Rigour with Commercial Strategy. I don't just find the partner; I structure the deal, negotiate the terms, and ensure it is commercially profitable.
